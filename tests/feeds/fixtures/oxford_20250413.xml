<description><span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div><div class="boxTitle">Summary</div>Cells differentiate to their final fates along unique trajectories, often involving multi-potent progenitors that can produce multiple terminally differentiated cell types. Recent developments in single-cell transcriptomic and epigenomic measurement provide tremendous opportunities for mapping these trajectories. The visualization of single-cell data often relies on dimension reduction methods such as UMAP to simplify high-dimensional single-cell data down to an understandable two-dimensional (2D) form. However, these dimension reduction methods are not constructed to allow direct interpretation of the reduced dimensions in terms of cell differentiation. To address these limitations, we developed a new approach that places each cell from a single-cell dataset within a simplex whose vertices correspond to terminally differentiated cell types. Our approach can quantify and visualize current cell fate commitment and future cell potential. We developed CytoSimplex, a standalone open-source package implemented in R and Python that provides simple and intuitive visualizations of cell differentiation in 2D ternary and three-dimensional (3D) quaternary plots. We believe that CytoSimplex can help researchers gain a better understanding of cell type transitions in specific tissues and characterize developmental processes.<div class="boxTitle">Availability and Implementation</div>The R version of CytoSimplex is available on Github at <a href="https://github.com/welch-lab/CytoSimplex">https://github.com/welch-lab/CytoSimplex</a>.

<description><span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div><div class="boxTitle">Motivation</div>Accurately predicting RNA subcellular localization is crucial for understanding the cellular functions and regulatory mechanisms of RNAs. Although many computational methods have been developed to predict the subcellular localization of lncRNAs, miRNAs and circRNAs, very few of them are designed to simultaneously predict the subcellular localization of multiple types of RNAs. In addition, the emergence of pre-trained RNA language model has shown remarkable performance in various bioinformatics tasks, such as structure prediction and functional annotation. Despite these advancements, there remains a significant gap in applying pre-trained RNA language models specifically for predicting RNA subcellular localization.<div class="boxTitle">Results</div>In this study, we proposed RNALoc-LM, the first interpretable deep learning framework that leverages a pre-trained RNA language model for predicting RNA subcellular localization. RNALoc-LM uses a pre-trained RNA language model to encode RNA sequences, then captures local patterns and long-range dependencies through TextCNN and BiLSTM modules. A multi-head attention mechanism is employed to focus on important regions within the RNA sequences. The results demonstrate that RNALoc-LM significantly outperforms both deep learning baselines and existing state-of-the-art predictors. Additionally, motif analysis highlights RNALoc-LMâ€™s potential for discovering important motifs, while an ablation study confirms the effectiveness of the RNA sequence embeddings generated by the pre-trained RNA language model.<div class="boxTitle">Availability</div>The RNALoc-LM web server is available at <a href="http://csuligroup.com : 8000/RNALoc-LM">http://csuligroup.com : 8000/RNALoc-LM</a>.

<title>Clustering individuals using INMTD: a novel versatile multi-view embedding framework integrating omics and imaging data</title>

<description><span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div><div class="boxTitle">Motivation</div>Combining omics and images can lead to a more comprehensive clustering of individuals than classic single-view approaches. Among the various approaches for multi-view clustering, nonnegative matrix tri-factorization (NMTF) and nonnegative Tucker decomposition (NTD) are advantageous in learning low-rank embeddings with promising interpretability. Besides, there is a need to handle unwanted drivers of clusterings (ie confounders).<div class="boxTitle">Results</div>In this work, we introduce a novel multi-view clustering method based on NMTF and NTD, named INMTD, that integrates omics and 3D imaging data to derive unconfounded subgroups of individuals. According to the adjusted Rand index, INMTD outperformed other clustering methods on a synthetic dataset with known clusters. In the application to real-life facial-genomic data, INMTD generated biologically relevant embeddings for individuals, genetics and facial morphology. By removing confounded embedding vectors, we derived an unconfounded clustering with better internal and external quality; the genetic and facial annotations of each derived subgroup highlighted distinctive characteristics. In conclusion, INMTD can effectively integrate omics data and 3D images for unconfounded clustering with biologically meaningful interpretation.<div class="boxTitle">Availability and implementation</div><a href="https://github.com/ZuqiLi/INMTD">https://github.com/ZuqiLi/INMTD</a><div class="boxTitle">Supplementary information</div>Supplementary data are available at <span style="font-style:italic;">Bioinformatics</span> online.</span></description>

<title>Refining Boolean models with the partial most permissive scheme</title>

<description><span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div><div class="boxTitle">Motivation</div>In systems biology, modelling strategies aim to decode how molecular components interact to generate dynamical behaviour. Boolean modelling is more and more used, but the description of the dynamics generated by discrete variables with only two values may be too limited to capture certain dynamical properties. Multivalued logical models can overcome this limitation by allowing more than two levels for each component. However, multivaluing a Boolean model is challenging.<div class="boxTitle">Results</div>We present MRBM, a method for efficiently identifying the components of a Boolean model to be multivalued in order to capture specific fixed-point reachabilities in the asynchronous dynamics. To this goal, we defined a new updating scheme locating reachability properties in the most permissive dynamics. MRBM is supported by mathematical demonstrations and illustrated on a toy model and on two models of stem cell differentiation.<div class="boxTitle">Availability and Implementation</div>The MRBM method and the BMs used in this manuscript are available on GitHub at: <a href="https://github.com/NdnBnBn/MRBM">https://github.com/NdnBnBn/MRBM</a>, and archived in Zenodo (doi: 10.5281/ZENODO.14979798).<div class="boxTitle">Supplementary information</div>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.</span></description>
